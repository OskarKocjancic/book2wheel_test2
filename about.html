						<h1>Our story</h1>
						<p>
							&nbsp;When Furqan Rathore, the founder of Book2Wheel, took a break from his education and moved to the Philippines for a year in 2015, he discovered a problem of mobility faced by many foreigners visiting the Philippines.<br />
							&nbsp;During his first month, he met more than 50 interns from Denmark who were looking for a 5-months transportation solution. Furqan had one motorbike at that moment and he offered a rental proposal. Two girls accepted the offer and through word of mouth, the news about Furqan’s rental proposal started to spread. He quickly added more motorcycles in the fleet, but it was not enough for the growing demand.<br />
							&nbsp;Therefore, he asked his friends and other motorcycle rental shops if they want to have their motorcycle rented out and make some extra money. When all of them agreed, he got the idea to make a website that connects people who wish to share their vehicle to people who would like to rent one.

Furqan Rathore moved back to Denmark in 2016 and won the First Danish entrepreneurship award in 2016. While studying, Furqan has started working on his business idea. Due to student visa restrictions in Denmark, Furqan could not register his company in Denmark.

Finally, in 2019, Furqan Rathore succeeded in obtaining a startup visa in Denmark and registered Book2Wheel aps (CVR no. 40573542).
